Hi Everyone, this is my new project. 

If you want to know the details of frontend or backend, please read the README.md inside frontend or backend folder

Frontend: ReactJS (Typescript)

1. Add Mui For My material ui framework
2. Add react router dom v5 for the routing
3. Basic design for my web app

| Logo | Program | Diet         | Exercises     | Booking | Useful Resource | Progress                               |
|------|---------|--------------|---------------|---------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
|      | Day1    | Rest Day     | Back          |         |                 | Some charts to show the process        |
|      | Day2    | Training Day | Chest         |         |                 | Volumn....                             |
|      | .....   | Macro        | ....Body Part |         |                 |                                        |

4. Add i18n for my app

5. pull before or after commit --> we should pull before commit
6. For the chart: we may use the chart js
7. https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/ --> for the side bar 

8. if we use context to store the sidebar content --> it doesnt work for a suitation: if we refresh the page, the context will become null, then the sidebar content will become empty.
    so we need to use another method to achieve the goal.


Backend: NestJS (Typescript)
    DB: PostgreDB
    TypeORM
